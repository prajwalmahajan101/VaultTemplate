## Notes

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. 

In other words, derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes without altering the desirable properties of the program. This ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass without breaking the application.
