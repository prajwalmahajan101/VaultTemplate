## Notes

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle encourages creating specific interfaces rather than one general-purpose interface.

By following ISP, we avoid creating "fat" interfaces that force classes to implement methods they don't need, leading to cleaner, more focused code that is easier to maintain and refactor.
