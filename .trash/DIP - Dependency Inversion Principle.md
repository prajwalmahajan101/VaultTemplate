## Notes

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

This principle helps create more flexible and maintainable code by reducing the coupling between components and promoting the use of interfaces or abstract classes to define interactions.
